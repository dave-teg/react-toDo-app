# React To-Do App

This is a simple and intuitive To-Do List web application built using React.js. The app allows users to:

* Add new tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Remove tasks
* Search through tasks in real-time

Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring they persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
